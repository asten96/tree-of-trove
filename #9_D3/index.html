			<h1>Hello, and welcome to the Trove of Life!</h1>

			<p>This is our data visualiation tool for the database called
			Trove. Put simply, it is an interactive application where you type
			in a search, all the possible data is shown in one handy
			visualisation.</p>

		<h1>FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h1>

		<h2>How do I use this?</h2>
	</div>

	<div class="well">
		<p>So to start using our application, simply type in any search term
		and wait a few seconds. Shortly, the rings should start to form
		properly and the chart will take form. Again, shortly after that,
		bubbles will appear on the outside of the ring which will house
		pictures taken from the search you just did. That is essentially it!
		The application is fully interactive and you can click on rings to view
		them better, and mouse over images to enlarge them.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="page-header">
		<h2>What is the Trove of Life?</h2>
	</div>

	<div class="well">
		<p>The Trove of Life is a data visualisation tool for the Trove
		database. From a single search term, the application retrieves the
		search results and applies them to multiple pie charts, which will load
		after a few seconds. What you can see in the application is that each
		ring is a category of search, for example image or article, and the pie
		chart part represents that data in the relevant subcategory.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="page-header">
		<h2>Why Make the Trove of Life?</h2>
	</div>

	<div class="well">
		<p>Data is the big word of today. So many companies revolve around the
		storing of large amounts of data and such, and is always the talk in
		the IT industry. But what if you wanted to visualise that data within a
		certain search? Well, that’s where the idea of the Trove of Life comes
		in. While this particularly applies to the Trove database, this
		application can be applied to many different searches with a great API
		such as Trove’s.</p>

	</div>
		<div class="page-header">
		<h2>Can I access FAQ within the application?</h2>
	</div>

	<div class="well">
		<p>Of course, all you have to do is click the information
		button which will either be placed top left or the bottom left of your screen.  This will bring up these exact FAQ for you to read.</p>
	</div>

		<div class="page-header">
		<h2>What features are part of the application?</h2>
	</div>

	<div class="well">
		<p>This application simply represents the data within a Trove search.  As such, it has been made so that access to most of that is readily available.  Within the circle itself, you can mouseover the respective parts of the pie chart and look at how many results were pulled from said search.  If you want a larger look at a specific section, simply click on that section and it will enlarge for you. <br/><br/>
		The pictures that come with the search (provided there are images available) will pop up around the circle.  These can be moused over to have a closer look at.  The leaves that are in the application are simply there to create the tree feel, and also shows that a new search is made by it's animation.  <br/>
		There is also a legend on the left hand side that shows the sections are the color of said section.  </p>
