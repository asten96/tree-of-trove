		<p>So to start using our application, simply type in any search term and wait a few seconds.  Shortly, the rings should start to form properly and the chart will take form.  Again, shortly after that, bubbles will appear on the outside of the ring which will house pictures taken from the search you just did.  That is essentially it!  The application is fully interactive and you can click on rings to view them better, and mouse over images to enlarge them. </p>

      </div>
      <div class="well">
	    <p>The Tree of Trove is a data visualisation tool for the Trove database.  From a single search term, the application retrieves the search results and applies them to multiple pie charts, which will load after a few seconds.  What you can see in the application is that each ring is a category of search, for example image or article, and the pie chart part represents that data in the relevant subcategory.

	    <p>Data is the big word of today.  So many companies revolve around the storing of large amounts of data and such, and is always the talk in the IT industry.  But what if you wanted to visualise that data within a certain search?  Well, that’s where the idea of the Tree of Trove comes in.  While this particularly applies to the Trove database, this application can be applied to many different searches with a great API such as Trove’s.  </p>
