			<h1>Hello, and welcome to the Tree of Trove!</h1>

			<p>This is our data visualiation tool for the database called
			Trove. Put simply, it is an interactive application where you type
			in a search, all the possible data is shown in one handy
			visualisation.</p>

		<h2>How do I use this?</h2>
	</div>

	<div class="well">
		<p>So to start using our application, simply type in any search term
		and wait a few seconds. Shortly, the rings should start to form
		properly and the chart will take form. Again, shortly after that,
		bubbles will appear on the outside of the ring which will house
		pictures taken from the search you just did. That is essentially it!
		The application is fully interactive and you can click on rings to view
		them better, and mouse over images to enlarge them.</p>

	<div class="page-header">
		<h2>What is the Tree of Trove?</h2>
	</div>

	<div class="well">
		<p>The Tree of Trove is a data visualisation tool for the Trove
		database. From a single search term, the application retrieves the
		search results and applies them to multiple pie charts, which will load
		after a few seconds. What you can see in the application is that each
		ring is a category of search, for example image or article, and the pie
		chart part represents that data in the relevant subcategory.</p>

		<h2>Why Make the Tree of Trove?</h2>
	</div>

	<div class="well">
		<p>Data is the big word of today. So many companies revolve around the
		storing of large amounts of data and such, and is always the talk in
		the IT industry. But what if you wanted to visualise that data within a
		certain search? Well, that’s where the idea of the Tree of Trove comes
		in. While this particularly applies to the Trove database, this
		application can be applied to many different searches with a great API
		such as Trove’s.</p>
